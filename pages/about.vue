    <h2>Who Am I</h2>

    <p>I simply wanted to become a therapist when I was in high school because I have always felt fascinated by people and their stories and how everyone has a unique, individual experience. As I matured, I realized how wonderful therapy can be to help people gain insight into their connection with themselves and the world around them. I am passionate about mental health and I can't fathom doing anything else with my life. </p>

    <p>I believe that therapy truly is for everyone in the sense that it can help foster self-discovery and lasting change, and I am lucky to be a part of that process.</p>
