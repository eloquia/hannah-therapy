    <h2 class="mb-8 text-2xl">Day One</h2>

    <p class="mb-8">In our first session, we'll focus on getting to know each other. Iâ€™ll ask about what brought you to therapy, your current concerns, and any relevant background information. This is also your chance to ask questions and share anything you feel comfortable with. We'll talk about goals for therapy and how the process works, including confidentiality. The aim is to create a safe space and start building a trusting relationship, so you can feel supported moving forward.</p>
