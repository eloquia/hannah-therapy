    <p class="mb-8">I approach goal setting with clients as an ongoing thing. I prefer to have a goal for each session and like to discuss that goal at the beginning of every meeting to help the session stay focused and productive for the client. I believe that there is no goal that is too small and that understanding one's goals can help the client see a bigger picture. </p>
