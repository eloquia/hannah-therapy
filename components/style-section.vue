    <p class="mb-8">The therapeutic approaches that I tend to use with clients is focused on CBT, DBT, ACT, and mindfulness/somatic based strategies. I enjoy challenging a client's mindset in order to help them gain more insight into how their thoughts and behavior patterns affect them both positively and negatively. I believe that all these approaches are a collaborative process between a client and therapist so that the client can eventually become their own therapist in to target their own needs and move towards their goals. </p>

    <p>My communication style as a therapist is warm, open, and collaborative. I strive to create a safe and non-judgmental space where clients feel heard and understood. I aim to be clear and direct when explaining concepts, while also being sensitive to each client's emotional needs. I listen deeply and ask thoughtful questions to help clients explore their thoughts and feelings. My approach is adaptable, so whether clients need gentle encouragement or more structured guidance, I tailor my communication to meet them where they are at in their journey. </p>
